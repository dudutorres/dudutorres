I am a brazilian creative 🇧🇷, married to a vet 🐘, father of 3 boys 👦👦👦 and 2 dogs 🐕🐕, who recently moved from Rio de Janeiro to Burlington, Ontario 🇨🇦. It was the most difficult and bold decision we had to make in our lives, but totally worth it. We wanted to give our kids a life full of freedom, diversity, connection to nature 🌲 … and to give them the opportunity to become citizens of the world 🌐 (aside from trying to get our Canadian citizenship, I am also getting my Portuguese one). I lost many great opportunities in my life for having to deal with visas and work permits, so I want them to be able to become global citizens, without these hassles. We’ve become much stronger as a family.

I have recently joined Github :octocat:, and before that I was a Creative Lead at SweetRush, one of the most respected companies in the training industry. I am joining the Learning & Development team as the Visual Design Lead and I am extremely excited to start collaborating with all of you, and to learn every single day.

I have a strong interest in the future and what it holds for us, especially when speaking about emerging technologies 👨‍💻. Also, in my free (me) time I love to play videogames 🎮, VR and binge-watch 📺 (specially psychological thrillers, dystopian, futuristic, mind-bending series and movies). I am also addicted to music 🎵, and into discovering new artists every single day.

Here are some recent pictures of our family:
